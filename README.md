## Notes

While building this app, starting was the hardest. I was not sure which variable should be a state variable and which ones shouldn't. I took it one step at a time, first creating the card, the taking care of what happenes when the user clicks next button. And then I created the boolean that keeps track of when the card is fliped or not fliped. I struggled with animating the flip on the card but after some research, I got it to work.
